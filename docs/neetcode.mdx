# Solve the question game!


**NeetCode:** [Do NeetCode 250 →](/neetcode250)

In these games, your goal is to understand and eventually solve a problem asked with an exact expected answer.

Try to do only one problem per session, then you’re done.

*(optionally): try to solve an old problem in a different way instead of trying a new problem!*

## *But how to actually make progress?*

- Look up tutorials *(type in the name of the problem)*
- read NeetCode onsite explanations *(if available, some are paywalled)*
- if stuck after that, read code solutions / ask for help
- Until you get the one **right answer!**

## Extra Tip

Games are grouped by categories *('Arrays and Hashing', 'Two Pointers', 'Heap / Priority Queue').* Each category has a specific technique you’ll want to learn and remember *(you can also look up tutorials on the entire category).*
