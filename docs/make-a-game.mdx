# Make a game!

Your goal is: Make a game!

How: literally do **anything** (tutorials, AI, ask for help).

BUT: you must actually try to create a game.

You can do as many sessions as you want on your game until it’s finished.

## Requirements

- Make a GitHub repository link **or** a downloadable build (.exe, web, etc.) with a playable game.


## -- GAMES YOU'VE MADE --
- None
